Project Description:

Bucket List is an app for tracking places you want to visit and things that you want to do during your stay on this earth.

Approach:

-We started off by discussing project ideas, user stories, and models.
-We split into pairs to tackle the back end with one pair working on the models and controllers and the other pair working on views.
-After that, we moved on to the front end and added CSS.

Installation Instructions:
-Fork and clone bucket_list (https://github.com/rewarren/bucket_list).
-Run npm install.
-Run node index.js.
-Open the project in the browser at localhost:3000.

Major Hurdles:
-We had trouble using the Google Maps API to display multiple markers. We also had issues saving the markers.
-We struggled with CRUD functionality for contents. We also struggled connecting contents to lists via the foreign key id.
-We also had trouble referencing ids in models.
-We had issues with deploying to Heroku.

Unsolved Problems:
